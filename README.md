If this or weeklySelectRange is not specified, the default mode is daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| priorRangePresets  | array<object> | Optional          | An array of object that specify the range buttons to appear for user to select prior range from the CURRENT date. If you want a pre-selected range add a property called isDefault: true. The object MUST have a property called 'value' to display it. 'value' is a number. 'value' is a range that will allow the user to select date range from CURRENT date once clicked. The range will conform with minSelectDate, maxSelectDate, weeklySelectDate, monthlySelectDate parameters if these parameters are set. If you currently in a different month view, clicking on any of the prior button will reset your current view back to the CURRENT month. If your selection mode is 'singleDate', this option will NOT come into effect. Example : [{value: 20, isDefault: true}, {value: 45}, {value : 90}] |
| maxForwardMonth    | string        | Optional          | Setting the max month which the NEXT button allowed to work. Format is MM/YYYY. January starts as 0. This setting will override the setting in forwardMonths. For example, you set the starting month as August 2013, with forwardMonths is 3, maxForwardMonth is 10/2013, your calendar will miss the month November 2013, because it exceeds the maxForwardMonth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| minBackwardMonth   | string        | Optional          | Setting the min month which the PREVIOUS button allowed to work. Format is MM/YYYY . January start as 0. This setting will override the setting in backwardMonths. For example, you set the base month to be March 2014, with backwardMonths to be 3. You also set minBackwardMonths to be 1/2014. The calendar will not display January 2014, and Dec 2013, since minBackwardMonths override backwardMonths. Attempt to press PREVIOUS button won't work either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| startDate          | string/number | Optional          | Set the start date to be selected on the calendar. Accept dateString or Unix timestamp. Set this as a directive attribute if you want to be able to set this value in real time. This is the directive to use if you want to read the current selected start date. If minSelectDate is set, and startDate falls into a date that is earlier than minSelectDate, the startDate will be pumped up until it reaches a day that is not conflicted with minSelectDate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| endDate            | string/number | Optional          | Set the end date to be selected on the calendar. Accept dateString or Unix timestamp. Set this value as directive attribute if you want to be able to set this value in real time. This is the directive to use if you want to read the current selected end date. If maxSelectDate is set, and this endDate falls into a date that is later than maxSelectDate, endDate will be going backward till it reaches a date that is not conflicted with maxSelectDate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| applyCallback      | function      | Optional          | A callback function to call when the "Apply" button is pressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| selectionMode      | string        | Optional          | The selection behavior of the calendar. Support four options : 'twoClick', 'lastSelectedDate', 'singleDate', and 'disableDayClick'.

| disabled           | boolean       | Optional          | The boolean variable to dynamically disable toggle button of turn-calendar. The default is false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| timezone           | string        | Optional          | Allow to set and read calendar date according to a specified timezone. Note: you have to include timezoneJS(github.com/mde/timezone-js), with the proper setup in order to use this feature. If you decide to use timestamp to set the start date and end date, the result will be converted to the timezone date. The format will always be MM/dd/yyyy instead of regular locale format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| range-side-mode    | boolean       | Optional          | Show the prior range preset on the right side instead of on top. For this to work you have to supply a string through scope. See examples in index.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
Example:

```html
<turn-calendar start-day-of-week="1" starting-month="11" starting-year="2013"
				 forward-months="3" backward-months="3" min-select-date="'09/13/2013'"
				 weekly-select-range="30" monthly-select-range="60"
				 prior-range-presets="[{value: 20, isDefault: true}, {value: 45}, {value : 90}]"
				 max-forward-month="'10/2014'">
<turn-calendar>
```

All of the above options can be set through an option object. Pass in the option
object through attribute calendarOptions. If you set the same setting in attribute
and in option object, the value set in attribute will used over the value in
option object.

Real time update for following options are supported : startDate, endDate,
minSelectDate, maxSelectDate, minBackwardMonth, maxForwardMonth, forwardMonths,
backwardMonths. These options have to set through attributes for real time
tracking to work. Setting through options object will not work.

The above code snippet will display 7 months instance, starting from Sep 2013
to March 2014, with Monday as the starting day of the week, the base month is
Dec 2013, it will change to weekly select mode if the cursor is 30 days beyond
the last selected date, monthly select mode if cursor is 60 days beyond the last
selected date. It will display 3 prior buttons: 20, 45, 90, with 25 is pre-selected
from the CURRENT date. Anything before 09/13/2013 is not available for selection.
Any month above Nov of the year 2014 is not allowed.
